OMG just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 Revelations and dude, I have so many thoughts lol. Like, first off, I wasn't ready for all these plot twists, my brain still trying to wrap around some of it. Seriously, have you 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 the   yet? If not, 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   asap because we need to talk about it, like, now.

Sooo, the design of that evil lair? Kinda loved it in this weird, can’t-tell-anyone way haha. I mean, the color palette was kinda dystopian chic, and those light fixtures had a mind of their own... literally. 😂 Not a fan of how they made the protagonist's apartment super cliché though. Like, we've all seen this ultra-𝘮𝘰𝘥ern, soulless vibe a million times. Come on, be original, peeps.

>suddenly, they just throw in this random meeting scene, right after the action? Like there was zero chill from battle to boardroom. Who does that?? Anyway, can we talk about the costumes too? I swear, I want that jacket the bad guy was wearing. It was total villain goals.

I was kinda getting tired halfway, not gonna lie, but then bam, new subplot. Like, slow your roll, we’re not even done processing the last bombshell. There was one moment I legit had to pause and wonder if the writers just threw darts at a board of 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 tropes. Also, did you notice how the soundtrack was sometimes outta sync with the scene? It was weirdly irritating, but also kinda charming?

Anyway, I seriously need coffee or a nap or something after all that. My head is still buzzing, but in a good way. We need a design collab inspired by the   vibes, don’t you think? Only cooler and with none of those odd scene changes.

int main() { printf(Why did I even paste this here?); return 0; }

Alright, gotta run—think I'll just try to chill a bit. Catch me later, and let's brainstorm, or more like just gossip about the wild ride that was. 😉
